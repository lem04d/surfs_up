# Surf's Up June and December Weather Analysis

Overview
Our client would like to know if it would be profitable to open their surf shop year-round based on historical weather data from June and December. 

Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)
* The average temperature in June in Hawaii is about 75 degrees while the average temperature in December is about 71 degrees. This represents a less than 4 degree difference in the temperature between the start of summer and the start of winter
* When looking at the difference between the max high and low temperature, there is a slight difference in the the temperature swings. We find in our historical data that June has a minimum temperature of 64 degrees and a maximum temperature of 85 degrees while December's minimum is 56 and maximun is 83.   
* Even when we look at where the majority of the temperatures fall across the quartiles, there is still only a 3 degree difference in the daily temperatures bewtween the months
Summary:

It is my opinion, based on the data, that if the surf shop is successfull during the month of June, that there should still be a demand during December as the temperatures are not incredibly different.  I would recommend also looking into the weather conditions such as rainy days vs sunny days because that may affect business at the shop.  Additonally, I would suggest running the same temperature and weather condition queries on July/August and January/February because those months can have more extreme temperatures and would have a substantial impact on year-round business
